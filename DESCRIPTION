Description: Fast fitting of Stable Isotope Mixing Models in R. Allows for the inclusion of covariates. Also has built-in summary functions and plot functions which allow for the creation of isospace plots. Variational Bayes is used to fit these models, methods as described in: Tran et al., (2021) <arXiv:2103.01327>.
